    <h5 class="card-title">Robert Bertram</h5>
<p>I founded Bertram Technologies in 2018 to turn my two-plus years of studying programming across various languages and applications into a profession.</p>
<p>Through working in sales - both technology- and non-technology-related - I'd learned to apply my skills towards solving business problems.</p>
<p>Creating a solution and finding a problem to apply it to was how I did things academically, but in the real world, it's necessary to tailor the solution to the problem, and that's what Bertram Technologies has set out to do.</p>
<p>Web and app development is interesting, but the application of machine-learning is more interesting, and that's my goal.</p>
<p>To solve business problems with technology.</p>
